Design:

The application should have a simple and user-friendly UI interface that allows users to upload a code file or paste a code snippet.
The UI should have a clear and prominent "Upload" or "Choose File" button that opens a file picker dialog when clicked.
The UI should also have a textarea where users can paste their code snippet.
Once the file is uploaded or the code snippet is pasted, the UI should have a "Generate Test Cases" button that triggers the test case generation process.
The UI should display the generated test cases in a readable and easy-to-understand format.
The UI should also provide an option to download the generated test cases as a file.

TEST CASE:

{ "codeSnippet": "function addNumbers(a, b) {\n return a + b;\n}\n\nconsole.log(addNumbers(3, 5));" }
